<h1>Iryna Kremarenka</h1><p>My phone is +37061366357 and my Email is ira.kremarenko@mail.ru</p><p>I believe that one of the main components of human life is self-development, which is why I always try something new, like online courses or just video tutorials on YouTube opening more and more opportunities for me becoming the best version of myself.I have always enjoyed problem solving and brainstorming process and find programming a perfect solution for this purpose. I get satisfied when finding bugs in the code when I practice as I believe, it helps to improve my skills.</p>
<p>As for skills I've learned the basics of HTML5, CSS and Javascript and am able to build simple web pages.</p><p>I have't got a lot of experience yet but hope to practice a lot during this course and ready to put as much affort as possible for successful completion.</p>
